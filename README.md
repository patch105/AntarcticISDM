## Project overview
Integrated species distribution models (ISDMs) have the potential to provide better predictions than models fitted to single data types, but this has never been tested in scenarios of spatial transfer. Here, we test the performance of integrated, presence-only, and presence-absence models in simulated model transfer scenarios that emulate common causes of spatial model transfer failure: environmental dissimilarity, spatial autocorrelation, and bias in the presence-only dataset.

In Antarctica, spatially constrained survey design and an urgent need for improved prediction of biodiversity patterns motivates the use of ISDMs to predict species distributions at understudied sites. We therefore also perform a case study, testing whether models fitted with and without model integration of presence-only and presence-absence data can provide more accurate predictions of moss and lichen distributions in East Antarctica. We validate model predictions fitted at one location with a separate systematic survey at a distinct location in East Antarctica.
